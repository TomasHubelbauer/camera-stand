# Camera Stand

![](camera-stand.3mf/Metadata/thumbnail.png)

This repository hosts the development of a 3D model for a 3D printed part that
is used to mount my camera to use as a webcam behind my screen.

I develop the part in OpenSCAD configured to export ASCII STL, slice it using
PrusaSlicer with a script to unzip the 3MF project file to a directory of the
same name and print it using a Prusa MK3S 3D printer.

The part sits on top of the VESA mount the monitor is secured to the wall with.

As of current, I am testing for a fit with the space between the mount plate and
the wall and the other side of the mount and the curved back of the screen.

It seems the mount plate to wall distance is around 21 mm and I am winging the
dimensions between the back of the screen and the mount plate. The mount plate
is also circular and I will later try to design the part so that it sits snug on
top of the mount plate and stays level by attaching to a horizontal piece used
to screw the two mount parts together that sticks out from the mount plate.
